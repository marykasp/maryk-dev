          <p>This site was created to share my coding journey experience. To help flesh out the knowledge in my own mind and maybe help a few who are also pushing through the world of tech. My main motivation for this site (besides being a requirement from LS) is to share and document notes for myself, and hopefully connect with other students or developers.</p>
          <p>Check out the <Link to="/projects">projects</Link> page to see the things I have worked on in the past, before deciding to join Launch School. Hoping to add more open-source projects I've made as I continue through the courses.</p>
          <p>A little about myself for those who are curious: I used to work as a research scientist in a **Genetics** lab for nearly a decade. Before that I worked as a chemist before realizing my passion was more in the medical field. So I spent more time in school and moved on to working in a biology lab in Chicago.</p>
          <p>Fast forward to the present and I have decided to switch careers again. Maybe third time is a charm? We shall see, so I found myself taking the plunge and subscribing to Launch School Program the beginning of 2022. About a month later and I am finally here to share what I have learned. </p>
