Hello, my name is Mary and I am a new Launch School student. Started the paid portion of the program about 3 weeks prior. I currently am still in the first Ruby course - _RB101_ - and hope to be attempting the assessment by next month.

One thing I have come to terms with is that everyone works at their own pace. I am not trying to rush through the material when it is all so new to me. I slowly each day am coding, practicing problem solving, and spending time rereading the lessons.

One of my goals for this year was to document my journey in the program. Then I came upon the LS lesson that encourages us to start a blog. I could have jumped in right away and started posting on [Medium](https://medium.com/) but I wanted to challenge myself. I've been interested in [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) for a couple years and always wanted to try to set up a static site myself -- so I found this _assignment_ to be the perfect opportunity for me to dive right in.

I must be honest and admit that I bit off more than I could chew. But as the following quote states - life is about challenging yourself and learning along the way. The only way to grow is by making mistakes and pushing yourself to do better.

> Life is about accepting the challenges along the way, choosing to keep moving forward, and savoring the journey. -- **Roy T. Bennett**

Now here it is - the completed blog in all its glory. Still needs a lot of work, but I am for now content I managed to produce something that resembles a blog. As the year goes on I will be tweaking the code, making it more functional, and trying to make it more managable.

Now back reflecting on previous years and where I am at now in life. 2022 has started off great. It is crazy to think that only 2 months ago, I was working full time as a research scientist in genetics. The past couple years were incredibly rough due to project deadlines, supply chain issues, and also helping generate antibody tests for Covid. Basically it was 2 years of non stop working and I realized I was getting burnt out.

So fast forward to the end of 2021 and I decided to make a major life change and pull back from working so much and I officially joined [Launch School](https://launchschool.com/). I am excited for the journey ahead and am looking forward to hopefully meeting new people on a similar path. It's exciting and terrifying at the same time to completely switch gears after nearly a decade doing something else. I do think that the change of pace, learning adventure, and knowledge to be gained are all worth it in the end.
