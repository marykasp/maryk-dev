Git is a difficult subject to tackle for self taught web developers who didn't learn to code with a team. If you've always worked alone and want an explanation of how to get started with Git, this tutorial is for you.

### Goals

- learn what Git actually is
- how Git useful when coding projects
- create a local Git project

## What is Git?

**Git** is a version control system (VCS) for code. It is used to keep track of versions of a project and make it easy for a developer team to work together on a project by using Git branches.

```ruby
arr = [1, 2, 3]

new_arr = arr.map do |number|
  number * 2
end

puts new_arr
```
